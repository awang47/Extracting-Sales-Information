#Inner join on the product_id columns of both the product_names table and the sales table. 

SELECT model, customer_id, sales_transaction_date, sales_amount,
       channel, dealership_id INTO products_sales FROM sales INNER JOIN 
       product_names ON sales.product_id=product_names.product_id

#The product_sales table has information available for the Bat Scooter. I am going to order the sales information by sales_transaction_date in ascending order. 
By wrangling the data this way, I can look at the first few days of the sales records in detail.

SELECT * FROM products_sales WHERE model='Bat' ORDER BY sales_transaction_date

#Here I am going to count the number of records available:

SELECT COUNT(model) FROM products_sales WHERE model='Bat'
(7328 sales, beginning October 10, 2016)

#Now I am going to determine the last sale date for the Bat Scooter:

SELECT MAX(sales_transaction_date) FROM products_sales WHERE
      model='Bat';
(The last sale in the database occurred on May 31, 2019)

#Here I am collecting daily sales volume for the Bat Scooter and place it in a new table called bat_sales to confirm the information provided by the sales team stating that sales dropped by 20% after the first 2 weeks:
SELECT * INTO bat_sales FROM products_sales WHERE model='Bat'
      ORDER BY sales_transaction_date

#Now removing the time information to allow tracking of sales by date. 
We don't need to know the time at which each sale occurred. 
      sqlda=# UPDATE bat_sales SET sales_transaction_date=DATE(sales_transaction_date)
      
#Create a new table containing the sales transaction dates and a daily count of total sales
 SELECT sales_transaction_date, COUNT(sales_transaction_date) INTO
      bat_sales_daily FROM bat_sales GROUP BY sales_transaction_date ORDER BY
      sales_transaction_date
 
#We aregoing to look at 3 weeks records as sales were reported to have dropped after approximately the first 2 weeks:

      sqlda=# SELECT * FROM bat_sales_daily LIMIT 22
      
(There is a drop in sales after October 20, as the sales drop to singled-digit sales volumne over the next 11 days)
